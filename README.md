# ImageToDistanceNet
DISCALIMER: everything except this readme is in italian.

An old project I made during my master. 
The notebook shows how to train a neural networks to recognise an object from an image and estimate its distance.
It goes in detail on how to practically do this. 
First Detectron2 is finetuned to recognise to desired object and used to build a basic representation of the image.
The representation is then given to a neural network that returns the distance.
Training is via supervised learning with a labeled dataset that cannot be uploaded on github and its available upon request.
